# File Organizer

A Python tool for automatically organizing files in your directories based on file types, dates, and other criteria.

## Problem

Many users struggle with cluttered directories containing mixed file types, making it difficult to find specific files. Manual organization is time-consuming and error-prone, especially when dealing with large numbers of files.

## Features

- **Automatic file type detection**: Organize files by extension (images, documents, videos, etc.)
- **Date-based organization**: Sort files by creation/modification date
- **Custom rules**: Define your own organization patterns
- **Safe operations**: Preview changes before applying them
- **Duplicate detection**: Identify and handle duplicate files
- **Batch processing**: Process multiple directories at once
- **Undo functionality**: Revert organization changes if needed
